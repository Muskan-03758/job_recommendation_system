# Emotion_Detection_Project
MoodEcho is an AI-powered emotion detection project that analyzes audio and text inputs to identify human emotions like happiness, sadness, anger, and more. It uses machine learning models and open-source datasets (like CREMA-D) to extract features, train classifiers, and visualize mood trends through an interactive dashboard.
